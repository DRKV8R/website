# DSD100

<img src="./assets/musheader.png" alt="Drawing"/>

The _dsd100_ is a dataset of 100 full lengths music tracks of different styles along with their isolated _drums_, _bass_, _vocals_ and _others_ stems.

_dsd100_ contains two folders, a folder with a training set: "train", composed of 50 songs, and a folder with a test set: "test", composed of 50 songs. Supervised approaches should be trained on the training set and tested on both sets.

For each file, the mixture correspond to the sum of all the signals. All signals are stereophonic and encoded at 44.1kHz.

The data from _dsd100_ consist of 100 tracks which are derived from [The 'Mixing Secrets' Free Multitrack Download Library](http://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/). Please refer to this original resource for any question regarding your rights on your use of the DSD100 data.
